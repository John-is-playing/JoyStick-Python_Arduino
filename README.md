# JoyStick-Python_Arduino
### English|[简体中文](/Chinese.md)
## What is this?
### This is a program designed to adapt the JoyStick Shield module, and it consists of two main programs, one is the Python program on the computer side, and the other is the Arduino UNO program.
## Why is there it?
### Since the JoyStick Shield cannot be connected directly to a computer and used as a XBOX360 controller, this program is to connect it to a computer as a controller (via the Arduino UNO).
## How to use it?
### Quite simply, it will be given below(this just for V1.A).
1. Buy an Arduino UNO (if you don't have one).
2. Buy a JoyStick Shield (if you don't have one).
3. Place the Arduino UNO and JoyStick Shield upright.
4. Insert Joystick Sharp Hilde into Arduino Uno.
5. Plug the data cable used by Arduinouno into Arduinouno and the computer.
6. Install the Arduino IDE (if you don't have one).
7. Install JoyStickShield.zip files in the project.
8. Compile and flash the program files in your project into Arduino UNO.
9. Turn on the serial monitor and move the joystick to see if there is any information.
10. Run the Python program, and the computer will plug in a virtual XBOX360 handle.
11. Give it a try!
